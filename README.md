# e-Dietary (e-Dietary) - PHP - 2023

## Overview

It is an honor for every developer to create a software that can asist users in their daily life. Therefore, we from Group AIS ALLURE BKAS3093_B had created a food management website namely e-Dietary website with the reference of project that been created by CodeAstro from the website of **CodeAstro** and from our previous group assignment **SSTHO**. This website is used to help all hospitals, nursing home, and confinement centers out there to improve the patient's health and residents and contribute to the sustainable use of resources. Besides, this system also is developed to meet SDG Goals 3 which is good health and well-being.

There are a lot of programming languages that a developer can use, however, this website is more focuses on **PHP**. Therefore, we had use **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **JavaScript** and **AJAX** in developing this application.  

First and foremost, we had created `index.php` file, which is the default entry point for any web application. All of e-Dietary instructions had been built in this file. **PHP** had been use to format the webpages as it is a powerful tool for making a dynamic and interactive webpages. 

However, **PHP** is quite limited in designing department. Hence, we had use **CSS** which is the **Cascading Style Sheets** together with the **Bootstrap** and **JavaScript**  to add specific fonts, colours, and a few elements that can make the website looks more visual dynamic.

There are a few challenges that we entitle during developing this application and the one that we would like to focus is on generating the food wastage calculator, filtering the patient meals menu and we are struggling to create a dynamic chart to be appeared on the dashboard.
